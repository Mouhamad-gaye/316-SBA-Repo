my web application is focusing on selling jerseys. I have created a one page web to shows how sale use the web to gather data and improve their sale. 
I have created an HTML and Style CSS to give an attractiveness to the page.
in my JS, i decided to make my page dynamic for the user to have a great experience and easy path to buy what they want.
In my JS page, I added an event listener to the add to cart buttons located in every jersey div in the HTML file. The way i did it is I selected all add to cart class via querySelectorAll. 
Then loop through all buttons using the foreach method. for each button, a click event listener is added. when the button is clicked, the function inside the eventlistener is executed.
same for the cart link, i made it interactive by adding an event listener and add elements through the DOM (cart items, total, clear buttons) so that users have a good visibility.

1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
  I coul have planned better and even write down what strategy I will use to meet a good result.

2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
  No requirements were difficult to implement, but my issue was knowing where to put certain tools in my DOM. Next, since we are scientist, I would implement anywhere I think is good and test it.

3.What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
I am sure there are many additional stuff i can add to my application, but with experience, I am sure it would be more dynamic.
